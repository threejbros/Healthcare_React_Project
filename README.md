My objective with this project is to turn a former class's group project from a computer application to a React Web application. Here, is the original repo for the group project (https://github.com/jdenver23/CS532Project).
This project will use React, Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB to help me better improve my skill and knowledge in that area of Full-Stack Programming

Currently, I am working on the Pharmacy Order Tracking component of the original project.
